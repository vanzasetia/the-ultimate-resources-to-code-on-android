Hi! I'm Vanza! I had coded on my Android for about six months and in this GitHub repo, I'm going to share everything you need to have to code on your Android device.

Here are some of the projects that I created on my Android device:

- [Profile Card Component](https://github.com/vanzasetia/profile-card-component) - a responsive card component
- [Huddle Landing Page with Single Introductory Section](https://github.com/vanzasetia/huddle-landing-page-with-single-introductory-section) - a responsive landing page
- [Huddle Landing Page with Alternating Feature Blocks](https://github.com/vanzasetia/huddle-landing-page-with-alternating-feature-blocks) - a responsive landing page

> All the projects that I list are coming from the [Frontend Mentor challenges](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges).
